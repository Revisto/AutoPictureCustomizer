These Python Scripts Resize Image to base width 1080pixels and Add Logo to Bellow Right.
there are 5scripts and each one does a different job:
if there is EVERYWHERE in the script name , it means that script will search even into each folder , if not it will search only the files in the place it runs , not in folders
if there is "Included_1" in the script name , it means that script will add logo to upside right if theres a picture named "1.jpg".
